  <p class="infoContext">Apartheid city planning hasn’t ended quickly enough, which means black South Africans still spend too much time and money travelling to work because they live on the outskirts of cities.</p>

    <h1>Long commute to freedom</h1>

  <p class="para">Black people in particular bear the brunt of a decade-long focus on building houses instead of cities “at whatever cost”.</br>This according to a data-driven investigation by City Press and Code for South Africa, which analysed the commuting time and access to public transport of commuters by race in the country’s largest cities.</br>The data, which was obtained from the most recent National Household Travel Survey, conducted in 2013 and released in 2014, shows that race remains a strong predictor of time spent travelling to and from work.</p>

  <!--<p class="infoContext">The National Household Survey has been designed by the Statistics South Africa in order to record, every 10 years,  the travel patterns, times and household characteristics in order to address challenges related to transport in the country.</p>-->

  <p class="para">In addition to the effects of apartheid spatial planning, the country was slow out of the blocks after 1994 to counter this legacy.</br>Ndivhuwo Mabaya, the spokesperson for Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, says: “From 1994 to 2004, our focus was [on] eradicating the housing backlog, at whatever cost. Spatial planning was not taken into consideration. It is a challenge we identified when we did the 10-year review.”</br>Despite a change of strategy after 2004 – to one that prioritises proximity to work and economic opportunities – the pace of change is slow.</br>While Professor Karina Landman of the University of Pretoria acknowledges that spatial patterns “don’t change overnight”, Statistics SA boss Pali Lehohla points to data obtained from the 2001 and 2011 censuses, which reveal that population density in the major cities has remained the same.</br>“Look at Cosmo City [established in 2005], the north of Pretoria and the east of Pretoria: the cities are sprawling outwards. That is exactly what apartheid’s fathers did. What they are doing makes the cost of living and doing business ever more expensive,” Lehohla says.
  How expensive, exactly?</br>A nationwide analysis of the expenses of commuters shows that the 20% of the population with the lowest income spend on average R486 a month on public transport, while the 20% with the highest income report a cost of R585 a month – a much heavier burden for the poor considering the proportion the amount makes up of their household income.</br>Discussing Cape Town’s Transport Development Index, councillor Brett Herron, mayoral committee member for transport in the city, says: “We discovered that [within] our public transport system, 95% of the users are from the low- and low-to-middle income group, and perhaps what is most shocking is the cost of transport. In the low-income category of people, they are spending 45% of their household income on transport. In some parts of the city, like in Atlantis, it is almost 60%.”</br></p>

  <h2>Workers also sacrifice valuable time</h2>

  <p class="para">In the eight cities analysed for this investigation, including Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, African and coloured people have the least access to public transport – measured by time spent walking to transport – and are forced to take longer journeys to work. For black residents of these cities, the average daily one-way commute lasts up to two and a half times that of white residents.</br>If you break down the data by household income, the difference remains. Among those who belong to a household earning less than R21 000 a month, black commuters spend on average 50 minutes travelling to and from work, while white people spend 36 minutes.In the eight cities analysed, black commuters in Pretoria are the worst off.</br>Makgorometje Makgata, the City of Tshwane’s strategic executive director for city planning and development, says in an effort to achieve spatial justice, a decision has been made that no major development will take place if it is more than 25km from the city. The city, he says, has approved two major high-density residential nodes towards Pretoria north and east.</br>“We are doing all this in an effort to bring people closer to the city.”</br>The National Household Travel Survey also measures how long it takes for commuters to reach the first available mode of transport, indicating how far they live from these services.
  In this instance, the worst city for black commuters is Cape Town, where black residents from households that earn less than R45 000 a month reported that it takes them 12 minutes to walk to their first available mode of transport, while for white residents, the average walking time is just three minutes. The same pattern can be observed in Pretoria, Johannesburg, Durban and Port Elizabeth.</br>Herron says the city has adopted a transit-oriented development strategy that is aimed at “ensuring that the development is aligned to our public transport network so we can start reducing travel time and cost. So [commuters] don’t use cars and can use public transport.”</br>However, the city’s plan to build new routes for its bus rapid transit (BRT) system is on a 20-year timeline.</br>“We have identified 10 new routes and we have planned BRT. In the public transport network plan, they want a new rail corridor that needs to be built. We are working with Prasa [the Passenger Rail Agency of SA], which already has a managing and planning team designing the route. We have 10 new BRT routes and one new rail route,” he said.</br>The National Household Travel Survey is conducted for the purposes of getting an “in-depth understanding of how and why people travel”</p>

  <h2>Rebotile Busang</h2>

  <p class="para">It’s 4pm on a Friday afternoon and Busang knocks off work at the Logistics Department of the South African Police Services station in Silverton. Buses and taxis whizz past as we wait at the stop. The late afternoon chill builds up.</p>
