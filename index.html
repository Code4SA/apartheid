    <h1>How Apartheid lives on</h1>
    <p class="byline">by Daniela Lepiz and Avantika Seeth</p>
  </div>
  
  <p class="para">More than 20 years have passed since the end of apartheid, and yet South Africans are living increasingly further apart.</p>

  <p class="para">A data-driven investigation by City Press and Code for South Africa analysed the commuting time and access to public transport of commuters across all race groups and income brackets in the country's largest cities.</p>

  <p class="para">The data, obtained from the most recent National Transport Survey (NHTS) conducted in 2013 and released 2014,  proves the reality among different population groups persist, showing how apartheid spatial design has been perpetuated.</p>

  <p class="infoContext">The National Household Survey has been designed by the Statistics South Africa in order to record, every 10 years,  the travel patterns, times and household characteristics in order to address challenges related to transport in the country.</p>

  <p class="para">Analysing the information by metro including Johannesburg, Pretoria, Ekurhuleni, Durban, Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, black and coloured people have the least access to public transport and are forced to take longer journeys to work. In most cases, the average commuting time for white South Africans - both on public transport and by car - is half the time of black.</p>

  <p class="para">Also, black South Africans, who live the furthest from central business districts, spend the highest proportion of their incomes getting to work and back each day.</p>

  <p class="para">The general mean for all income categories in Cape Town metropolitan area, shows a commuting time of 63 minutes for black population while only showing 38 minutes for white. The pattern remains in important cities like Johannesburg, showing a difference of 65 minutes, versus 46;and 78 minutes to 45 in Pretoria respectively.</p>

  <p class="para">Breaking down the data by household income, the difference also remains. For those who belong to a household earning less than 21 000 rands per month, commuting for the black population is more likely to last 50 minutes while only 35 minutes for white population.</p>

  <p class="para">Black commuters living in Pretoria experience the worst situation across all metros analysed where using public transport as their main mode of commuting, the journey can take  a mean of 80 minutes daily while only 44 minutes for white commuters.</p>

  <p class="infoContext">The difference of commuting is influence by many factors such as accessibility to transport, household income and location. Therefore the NHTS  monitors how long does it take for commuter to access the first transport mode in relation to where they live, showing, by default,  how far commuters live from these facilities.</p>

  <p class="para">In that regard, the worst city for black commuters is the City of Cape Town where black residents from households that earn less than 45 000 rands reported that it takes then 12 minutes to walk to their first available mode of transport, while for whites, the mean walking time was just 3 minutes. The same pattern can be observed in the different metros like Pretoria, Johannesburg, Durban and Nelson Mandela Bay.</p>

  <p class="para">The poor also pay dearly to get around.</p>

  <p class="para">A nation-wide analysis of the expenses of commuters identified that 20% of the population with the lowest income are forced to expend a mean of 486 rands monthly using public transport while the 20% with the highest income reports a cost of 585 rands monthly. While there is not a significant difference in the cost of transportation, the difference lies in the the household income of these two population groups, with low income earners having to pay the same costs for transportation as those earning higher.</p>

  <p class="para">With regards to driving the portion of the population falling within the second quintile expend 1840 rands , while people in the highest income quintile uses 1674 rands in mean.</p>

  <p class="para">Andrew Kerr, Senior Research Officer for Data First at the University of Cape Town published a paper last year titled Tax(i)ing the poor? Implications of our high commuting costs, for which he investigated how much money and time South African workers spent commuting to work, and how this has changed between 1993 and 2013.</p>

  <p class="para">Kerr found that the time costs of commuting in South Africa "are dramatically higher than OECD countries and that they have increased over the last 20 years".</br>Kerr also found that the costs of transport are also high – "higher than the target of 10% of commuter income suggested by the first post-Apartheid Department of Transport’s white paper" written in 1996.</br>"The increase for trains has been about 200% since 1993, whereas the means for bus and taxi have increased by 5 times", says Kerr's analysis.</p>

  <p class="para">In an interview three weeks ago, Councillor Brett Herron, Mayoral Committee Member for Transport, from the City of Cape Town said that structurally, the city of Cape Town still demonstrates what Apartheid was about.</br>“We have mostly black people living in the outskirts of the city and rely mostly on public transport to move. In many parts of the city they don't have a dignified transport offering, so journey times are long and costly,” he said.</br>According to the Transport Development Index which was conducted last year, the City of Cape Town wanted to measure what residents experience in terms of mobility.</br>"We discovered that [within] our public transport system, 95% of the users are from the low and low to middle income group and perhaps what is most shocking is the cost of transport," he said.</br>"So in the low income category of people, they are spending 45% of their household income on transport. In some parts of the city it is almost 60%, like Atlantis.”</br>In order to fix this, he believes that affordable housing needs to be made more accessible  closer to the city.</br>“Public and affordable housing is subsidised by grants funding and the parameters are quite restrictive so to achieve affordable housing in the right place requires some more [work].</br>"We adopted in March the Transit Orientated Development Strategy which aims at ensuring the development is aligned to our public transport network so we can start producing travel time and cost. So [commuters] don't use cars and can use public transport."</br>But the city's plan to build new routes for its bus rapid transit system is on a 20 year timeline.</br>“We have identified 10 new routes and we have planned BRT . In the public transport network plan they want a new rail corridor that needs to be built and it is from the south east to Khayelitsha to Bellville suburbs and we are working with Prasa who already have a managing and planning team designing the route. We have 10 new BRT routes and one new rail route,” he said.</p>

  <h2>Rebotile Busang</h2>

  <p class="para">Every day Rebotile Busang (33) a registry clerk from Soshanguve, travels 46km to work in Silverton, Pretoria, on a Putco bus.Although  her workplace is only XXkm away, she spends out three hours each day on the bus.</p>

  <p class="para">Black residents of Pretoria spent the longest amount of time in the country on public transport, an average of 88 minutes, a data analysis conducted by Code for South Africa and City Press found. And with a population of 403 162 residents living 25km to the north in Soshanguve, according to the 2011 census, that a lot of minutes to and from work every day.</p>

  <p class="para">It’s 4pm on a Friday afternoon and Busang knocks off work at the Logistics Department of the South African Police Services station in Silverton. Buses and taxis whizz past as we wait at the stop. The late afternoon chill builds up.</p>

  <p class="para">City Press joins Busang for the R20 ride home, the ticket bought from the driver. We take our seats in a fairly empty bus as Busang sits next to a friend. The passengers all know each other and are "always on the same bus", Busang says. It's a friendly intimacy built over years of travelling together on the bus for three hours a day.</br>“Everyone is friendly on the bus. We are all from Shoshanguve and we travel the same route every morning and evening to and from work," she says.</br>"I buy a weekly bus ticket, which is R156. There is a monthly ticket which can be bought, but I don’t trust the bus services because sometimes they don’t operate and then we are left stranded. It’s not as if we get that money back so this is a safer way for me to plan my travel costs.”</br>Busang stays in Block F in west Shoshanguve with her daughter Kebabetswe, her grandmother who receives a monthly state pension, her aunt who sells shoes and clothing and her cousin who is a mechanic. Apart from the day-to-day running of the household, she also has to see to the transport costs of Kebabetswe (7) as she travels to school with a lift club.</br>“For the two of us, I pay around R1200 a month. That includes my bus tickets and her transport to and from school," she says.</br>Aside from the cost, it's the travelling time Busang must navigate that eats away at the quality of her life.</br>"I am up every morning at 3.30am, because I have to make the lunches and get ready for the day. My daughter wakes up at 4.30am, and at first it was difficult for her to be up that early but now she’s used to it.”</br>A woman in a pink winter coat walks down the aisle of the bus, selling chips and frozen yoghurt.</br>“It’s going to be a long journey my darling, you’ll get hungry and need to eat. These chips are only R1 a packet,” she says.</br>"Everyone on this bus is like family. In the morning we even pray together," she adds before leading the commuters in a gospel song, her backdrop the sunset shining through the bus windows.</br>All around us passengers begin to shut their eyes, succumbing to the weariness brought about by such an early start. At around 5.30pm, after battling through traffic, the bus finally arrives in Shoshanguve.</p>
